***THIS TOOL IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. THERE MAY BE ISSUES, BUT IT WORKS PROPERLY WHEN USED AS OUTLINED HERE***

**After downloading there will be a gaussianDataTool exectuable. Right click it and create a shortcut to Desktop or other preferred location**

## Basics
- This tool first prompts the user to create either Gaussian or ORCA input. Select whichever you desire.
- If you are new to the tool it will prompt you to select a location to save the output files
	- The tool will prompt you for each option (Gaussian or ORCA input) once you click the respective button
	- Select the folder which you want your Gaussian/ORCA input files to be saved
- There is an `Advanced` tab in the window that allows you to change your save location for each tool when in the appropriate window
### Gaussian Input
- This will create Gaussian input files using .gjf files after GaussView protonation
    - As many amino acid files as you want can be used by using `Shift+Click` and/or `Ctrl+Click`
    - A single ligand file can be selected, which will be appended to the end of each amino acid file (with modification) to create the Gaussian .com input files
- Select the `Amino Acid Files` button to select one or more amino acid files
- Select the `Ligand File` button to select the ligand file
- Click `Start` to create the Gaussian input files
    - A popup will appear once the program is done
    - The files will appear in the previously-assigned save location
### ORCA Input
- This will create ORCA input files using .txt Gaussian output files
    - As many files as you want can be selected using `Shift+Click` and/or `Ctrl+Click`
- Select the `Select Files` button to select one or more Gaussian output file
    - The program should detect if at least one of the files are not Gaussian output files and prompt you to try selecting your files again
- Click `Start` to create the ORCA input files
    - A popup will appear once the program is done
    - The files will appear in the previously-assigned save location
